/*
Package apm is an opinionated approach to distributed application logging,
tracing, performance monitoring, metrics, and error alerting.

It's opinionated in that it requires minimal configuration, and it provides
strong defaults for development and production environments. It attempts to
"do the right thing" and get out of a developer's way.

It's also intended to be a successor to the tracer-go package, from which it
borrows heavily.
